`naturalistbot` shares observations from
[iNaturalist](https://inaturalist.org) on the fediverse. You can follow
[@naturalistbot](https://hachyderm.io/naturalistbot) to see the code in
action. Currently, the bot posts 4 times a day, observations that were
made a year ago.

The code is setup as an R package but there is no reason for you to
install it. It will not be submitted to CRAN. It is intended to live on
GitHub.

If you have suggestions to improve the bot or the code, feel free to
[open an
issue](https://github.com/fmichonneau/naturalistbot/issues/new/).

This bot is not affiliated to iNaturalist. If you want to support
iNaturalist, it is a non-profit that accepts
[donations](https://www.inaturalist.org/donate). You may also want to
consider a [donation](https://community.hachyderm.io/docs/thank-you/) to
hachyderm.io that hosts this account.
