The goal of naturalistbot is to share some observations from
[iNaturalist](https://inaturalist.org) on the fediverse.

The code is setup as a package but there is probably no reason for you
to install it. It will not be submitted to CRAN. It is intended to live
on GitHub.

If you have suggestions to improve the bot or the code, feel free to
[open an
issue](https://github.com/fmichonneau/naturalistbot/issues/new/).

This bot is not affiliated to iNaturalist. If you want to support
iNaturalist, it is a non-profit that accepts
[donations](https://www.inaturalist.org/donate).
