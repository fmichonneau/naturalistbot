`naturalistbot` shares observations from [iNaturalist](https://inaturalist.org)
on the fediverse. You can follow
[@naturalistbot](https://botsin.space/naturalistbot) to see the code in action.
Currently, the bot posts 4 times a day, observations that were made a year ago.

The code is setup as an R package but there is no reason for you to install it.
It will not be submitted to CRAN. It is intended to live on GitHub.

If you have suggestions to improve the bot or the code, feel free to [open an
issue](https://github.com/fmichonneau/naturalistbot/issues/new/).

This bot is not affiliated to iNaturalist. If you want to support iNaturalist,
it is a non-profit that accepts [donations](https://www.inaturalist.org/donate).
